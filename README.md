# üöÄ Route Flutter Bloc ‚Äî smart BLoC widgets that understand navigation
Avoid unnecessary rebuilds and side-effects when pages are hidden in the navigation stack.  
React only when needed. Improve performance without changing your app‚Äôs architecture. Works with the bloc library ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to change your development paradigm. You can always add this package without touching your existing code.

## Why use it?
route_flutter_bloc is a collection of enhanced versions of standard flutter_bloc widgets like BlocBuilder, BlocListener, and others.  
These widgets are navigation-aware ‚Äî they know when your page is on screen or hidden inside the Navigator stack, and behave accordingly.
Will this package work with your navigation system? - If RouteAware works for you, then this package will work too.

In a typical Flutter app using flutter_bloc, your BlocBuilder or BlocListener widgets always work, even when the page is not visible.  
This can lead to:  
‚Ä¢ üîÅ Unnecessary rebuilds that waste performance  
‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è Side-effects from BlocListener firing at the wrong time

## How this package solves it

This package upgrades the default behavior. All widgets behave the same as in flutter_bloc, except when the screen is hidden.

Here‚Äôs what you get:  
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ When the page is visible ‚Äî everything works as usual.  
‚Ä¢ üí§ When the page is in the navigator stack but not on screen ‚Äî widgets do nothing.  
‚Ä¢ üîÑ When the page becomes visible again ‚Äî widgets can:  
‚Ä¢ Rebuild (RouteBlocBuilder)  
‚Ä¢ React with side-effects (RouteBlocListener)  
‚Ä¢ But only if the state changed while the page was hidden.

BY DEFAULT, THESE WIDGETS STAY QUIET WHEN COMING BACK TO THE SCREEN.  
BUT IF YOU WANT THEM TO REACT ON RESUME, JUST ENABLE A FLAG:

‚Ä¢ rebuildOnResume: true for RouteBlocBuilder, RouteBlocConsumer, RouteBlocSelector  
‚Ä¢ triggerOnResumed: true for RouteBlocListener, RouteBlocConsumer

This ensures the widget reacts once with the latest changed state ‚Äî only if something really changed.

And yes ‚Äî even if the final state equals the original, widgets still react if there was a transition.  
For example:  
‚Ä¢ loaded ‚Üí loading ‚Üí loaded ‚Üí Triggers ‚úÖ  
‚Ä¢ loaded ‚Üí loaded ‚Üí No trigger ‚ùå

The widgets behave according to the standard BLoC paradigm.

## Want the original behavior?

No problem.  
You can make any widget behave like its flutter_bloc counterpart by enabling:  
‚Ä¢ forceClassicBuilder: true  
‚Ä¢ forceClassicListener: true  
‚Ä¢ forceClassicSelector: true

This disables the route-aware logic and makes widgets work always, regardless of screen visibility.

## üß≠ Route Awareness Setup

This package relies on Flutter's `RouteObserver` (via `RouteAware`) to detect when a page is on screen or hidden in the navigation stack.

You need to pass the RouteObserver instance using the RouteObserverProvider widget.

```dart
final RouteObserver<Route<dynamic>> routeFlutterBlocObserver =
    RouteObserver<Route<dynamic>>();

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return RouteObserverProvider(
      observer: routeFlutterBlocObserver,
      child: RouteBlocProvider(
        create: (_) => CounterCubit(),
        child: MaterialApp(
          navigatorObservers: [routeFlutterBlocObserver],
          home: const FirstPage(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
You can also pass the observer directly to widgets:
```dart
RouteBlocBuilder<CounterCubit, int>(
  observer: routeFlutterBlocObserver,
  rebuildOnResume: true,
  builder: (_, state) {
    return Text(
      'State: $state',
    );
  },
);
```
## RouteBlocListener behavior

By default, RouteBlocListener fires only when the screen is visible.
If the page is inside the navigator stack ‚Äî it stays silent.

You can configure its behavior with:
```dart
bool triggerOnResumed = false; // Trigger once when returning to screen, only if state changed - false by default
bool forceClassicListener = false; // Always trigger like in flutter_bloc - false by default
```
**Example usage**
```dart
RouteBlocListener<CounterCubit, int>(
  triggerOnResumed: true,
  forceClassicListener: false,
  listener: (context, state) {
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(content: Text('Listener: $state')),
    );
  },
);
```

## RouteBlocBuilder behavior

By default, `RouteBlocBuilder` rebuilds only when the screen is visible.  
If the page is hidden inside the navigator stack, it does not rebuild.

You can configure its behavior with:
```dart
bool rebuildOnResume = false; // Rebuild once when returning to screen, only if state changed - false by default
bool forceClassicBuilder = false; // Always rebuild like in flutter_bloc - false by default
```

**Example usage**
```dart
RouteBlocBuilder<CounterCubit, int>(
  rebuildOnResume: true,
  forceClassicBuilder: false,
  builder: (context, state) {
    return Text('State: $state');
  },
);
```

## RouteBlocConsumer behavior

By default, `RouteBlocConsumer` rebuilds and listens only when the screen is visible.  
If the page is hidden inside the navigator stack, neither builder nor listener will be called.

You can configure its behavior with:
```dart
bool rebuildOnResume = false; // Rebuild once when returning to screen, only if state changed - false by default
bool triggerOnResumed = false; // Trigger listener once when returning, only if state changed - false by default
bool forceClassicBuilder = false; // Always rebuild like in flutter_bloc - false by default
bool forceClassicListener = false; // Always listen like in flutter_bloc - false by default
```

**Example usage**
```dart
RouteBlocConsumer<CounterCubit, int>(
  rebuildOnResume: true,
  triggerOnResumed: true,
  forceClassicBuilder: false,
  forceClassicListener: false,
  listener: (context, state) {
    print('Listener: $state');
  },
  builder: (context, state) {
    return Text('State: $state');
  },
);
```

---

## RouteBlocSelector behavior

By default, `RouteBlocSelector` rebuilds only when the screen is visible.  
If the page is hidden inside the navigator stack, it stays inactive.

You can configure its behavior with:
```dart
bool rebuildOnResume = false; // Rebuild once when returning to screen, only if selected value changed - false by default
bool forceClassicSelector = false; // Always rebuild like in flutter_bloc - false by default
```

**Example usage**
```dart
RouteBlocSelector<CounterCubit, int, String>(
  selector: (state) => 'Value: $state',
  rebuildOnResume: true,
  forceClassicSelector: false,
  builder: (context, value) {
    return Text(value);
  },
);
```
## RouteMultiBlocListener behavior

By default, `RouteMultiBlocListener` triggers its listeners only when the screen is visible.  
If the page is hidden inside the navigator stack, the listeners stay silent.

Each listener inside `RouteMultiBlocListener` accepts the same flags as `RouteBlocListener`, giving you full control per-listener.

You can configure each listener with:
```dart
bool triggerOnResumed = false; // Trigger once when returning to screen, only if state changed - false by default
bool forceClassicListener = false; // Always trigger like in flutter_bloc - false by default
```

**Example usage**
```dart

   RouteMultiBlocListener(
    listeners: [
      RouteBlocListener<CounterCubit, int>(
        triggerOnResumed: false,
        listener: (context, state) {
          ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
            SnackBar(content: Text('Counter: $state')),
          );
        },
      ),
      RouteBlocListener<CounterCubit, int>(
        triggerOnResumed: true,
        listener: (context, state) {
          setState(() => _counter = state);
        },
      ),
    ],
    child: SizedBox(),
  );

```
## RouteObserverProvider

`RouteObserverProvider` is a helper widget that provides a `RouteObserver` instance down the widget tree.  
It‚Äôs used internally by all `RouteBloc*` widgets to track route visibility and navigation events.

You only need this if you want to **inject your own `RouteObserver`** or use the system manually.

If you're using `route_flutter_bloc` alone, wrap your app once at the top:

**Example usage**
```dart
final RouteObserver<Route<dynamic>> routeObserver = RouteObserver<Route<dynamic>>();

void main() {
  runApp(
    RouteObserverProvider(
      observer: routeObserver,
      child: MaterialApp(
        navigatorObservers: [routeObserver],
        home: MyHomePage(),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

If you don‚Äôt provide a `RouteObserver`, the system will try to find one from context or fallback to default.

## RouteBlocProvider and MultiRouteBlocProvider
are copies of the standard flutter_bloc widgets.
They are included for convenience in case you‚Äôre using this package standalone.
If you‚Äôre already using flutter_bloc in your project, you can continue using the original BlocProvider and MultiBlocProvider widgets ‚Äî they will work just fine.
