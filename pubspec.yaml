name: route_flutter_bloc
description: Improve Flutter BLoC performance with navigation-aware widgets. Avoid rebuilds and side-effects when screens are hidden, and automatically respond when the page becomes visible again â€” but only if the state actually changed while it was hidden. Smart behavior, full control, zero boilerplate.
